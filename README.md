Map Journal
===========

The Story Map Journal is ideal when you want to combine narrative text with maps and other embedded content. A Map Journal contains entries, or sections, that users simply scroll through. Each section in a Map Journal has an associated map, image, video or web page. Actions can also be defined in journal sections so that, for example, clicking a word automatically zooms the sectionâ€™s map to a particular location.

## Introduction
A Map Journal application can be created from [ArcGIS Online](http://arcgis.com), from the [Esri Story Maps website](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/) or from a [Portal for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/extensions/portal-for-arcgis) deployment. The Journal's data are stored in a Web Application Item (this include the narrative content, reference to the webmap(s), pictures, videos and the settings).
This repository provide the application source code for developers that wants to implement UI customization.
See [FAQ](#deployment) for more details.

For more information about the Map Journal, including a gallery of examples and a step-by-step tutorial, please see the [Map Journal](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/) page on the [Esri Story Maps website](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/).

## Instructions
First create your Map Journal in ArcGIS Online using the [step-by-step tutorial](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/tutorial/).
Once your story is ready, you have to find its ID in ArcGIS Online. The ID is a 32 characters strings that you will find in your browser bar when you are consulting your journal.

1. [Download the application](http://links.esri.com/storymaps/map_journal_template_zip)
2. Deploy the application on your webserver. See [FAQ](#how-to-deploy-the-application-on-a-web-server) for details
3. Edit index.html, find look for the configuration section on line 38 and paste your application ID
4. Navigate to index.html (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/MapJournal/index.html`)

Enjoy!
You can continue to use the builder in ArcGIS Online to modify your story.
See [customize the look and feel section](#customize-the-look-and-feel) or [developer guide](#developer-guide) if you want to modify the app.

## FAQ

### Journal's checklist
We recommend that you perform the following checks before sharing your Journal with your audience:
 - Sign-out from ArcGIS Online and any service that you use to host your Journal's resources and make sure everything loads correctly. Alternatively [this article](http://browsers.about.com/od/faq/tp/Incognito-Browsing.htm) will show you how to configure your browser for an incognito session.
 - Try the application on different browser, screen resolution and mobile device. You can [emulate different device](http://mobiletest.me/) inside your browser.

### Application compatibility
Map Journal is supported on all major desktop browser (Internet Explorer version 9) as well as the major tablet and smartphone device.
Map Journal authoring is supported on all major desktop browser (Internet Explorer version 10) and on tablet but not on smartphone.

### Security

#### Can I keep my Journal private?
Yes, the regular ArcGIS Online security model applies. 
By default your Journal is private, you can share it through Map Journal builder or ArcGIS Online. 
When you share your Journal, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the resources of your Journal (webmaps, images, videos) are accessible to your audience.

#### Who can edit my Journal?
A Journal can only be edited by its owner (the named account that initially created the Journal). Organization Administrator (does not apply for public account) can take or give to another user the ownership of a Journal you have created. In that case the original owner can't edit anymore the Journal. Changing the ownership is the only way to collaborate on a Journal creation without sharing the owner's credentials.

#### Can I use private web map or layer?
Yes. 
When the Journal is hosted in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS, unauthorized user will be redirected to ArcGIS Online sign-in page.

When hosted on your web server, by default the authentication dialog will appear. Because of technical limitation on older browser we recommand that you [configure the application to use OAuth](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/user-javascript.html). If you prefer to not configure OAuth, for the authentication to work on some older browser  (Internet Explorer 9 and below) you need to install a proxy server on your web server to make sure the login credentials can be pass securely to ArcGIS Online. For more information, see the [Using the proxy](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html) in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation.

### Deployment
Deploying a Map Journal require to use ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. The Journal content have to be created using the Map Journal builder and will live in a Web Application Item.

#### Can I use the template without ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS?
This is not a supported use case at that time. Please let us know if you are interested by that scenario. 
Map Journal rely heavily on the Portal for ArcGIS API but it is doable to modify the application to support other scenario.

#### Where is the data stored?
The Journal's data are stored in a Web Application Item in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This include the narrative content, reference to the webmap(s), reference to picture(s), video(s), web page(s) and the settings.

The image and videos that you include in your Journal using the builder are not copied in ArcGIS Online. You have to make sure that these medias as well as the webmaps you are using are accessible to your audience without unneeded authentication.

#### Can I deploy Map Journal on Portal for ArcGIS?
Yes, we recommend that you deploy the application in the following folder `ArcGIS\Portal\webapps\arcgis#home\webmap\templates\MapJournal`. If this folder already contain a previous version, make sure to delete all of its content first. Then refer your Portal documentation for instructions on publishing a new web application item and adding it to the web application gallery. If you choose to deploy the template in another folder, some configuration will be required (see index.html). 


Then you should configure Map Journal to use the JavaScript API deployed on your Portal and not the one in ArcGIS Online. This is optional but strongly recommended as some incompatibility may occur. To change the JS API, edit `index.html` and locate `pathJSAPI` around line 100.


Also note that the web application gallery preview feature redirect to StoryMaps website, the target page can be modified in `app/config.js > HELP_URL`.

#### Can the template be used offline?
Yes, by using Portal for ArcGIS. When deployed on a Portal for ArcGIS instance, the application doesn't require any external service to function. But by default the template will still include the header social buttons and Journal author are able to import pictures and videos from the some online pictures hosting services. These options can be disabled individually through the configuration file app/config.js.

#### Can I use the builder without Portal for ArcGIS?
No, for technical reason at this time the builder can only be used in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. 
Let us know if you are interested, we can give you the technical details and help you modify the application to enable the builder.

#### How to deploy the application on a web server?
If you are not familiar with web servers here is three solutions:
 * Use a free hosting service like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), you may have to [configure Dropbox to enable webpage hosting](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder)
 * Use the web server that comes with your server Operating System. On Windows this is Internet Information Services(IIS), if you have a `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` folder on your computer, you should be able to access it's content using `http://localhost`
 * On Windows or Mac OS, use a simple web server like [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) (not recommanded for production)
