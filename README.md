Map Journal
===========

The Story Map Journal is ideal when you want to combine narrative text with maps and other embedded content. A Map Journal contains entries, or sections, that users simply scroll through. Each section in a Map Journal has an associated map, image, video or web page. Actions can also be defined in journal sections so that, for example, clicking a word automatically zooms the sectionâ€™s map to a particular location.

## FAQ

### Can I deploy Map Tour on Portal for ArcGIS?
Yes, just deploy the application in the following folder `ArcGIS\Portal\webapps\arcgis#home\webmap\templates\MapJournal`. If this folder already contain files, make sure to clear it before. Then refer your Portal documentation for instructions on publishing a new web application item and adding it to the web application gallery. If you choose to deploy the template in any other folder, some configuration will be required (see index.html configuration). Also note that the web application gallery preview feature won't be functional and give a 404 error.

### Can the template be used offline?
Yes, by using Portal for ArcGIS. When deployed on a Portal for ArcGIS instance, the application doesn't require any external service to function. But by default the template will still include the header social buttons and Journal author are able to import pictures and videos from the some online pictures hosting services. These options can be disabled individually through the configuration file app/config.js.

### Can I use the builder with the downloadable without Portal for ArcGIS?
No, not at this time. Let us know if you are interested.
